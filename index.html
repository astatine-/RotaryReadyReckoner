				<h3>What is Rotary?</h3>
				Rotary is a global network of more than <span class="boldgold">1.4 million</span> people of action in more than <span class="boldgold">46,000</span> clubs who share a passion for and commitment to <span class="boldgold">enhancing communities and improving lives</span> around the world. Rotary clubs exist in almost every country. Our members change lives locally and work on international projects. They take action and make a difference, and it brings them personal rewards and <span class="boldgold">lifelong friendships </span>in the process.

				<h3>History of Rotary</h3>
				<span class="bodytextlarge">
				We’ve been bringing our world closer together for over 100 years. The first Rotary
				club was started in Chicago, Illinois, USA, in <span class="boldgold">1905 </span> by an attorney named <span class="boldgold">Paul Harris</span>. Harris wanted to
				bring together a group of <span class="boldgold">professionals with different backgrounds and skills</span> as a way to exchange ideas
				and form meaningful acquaintances. In August 1910, the 16 Rotary clubs then in the United States formed the National Association of Rotary Clubs, now Rotary International. <span class="boldgold">Rotaract began in 1968</span> as a Rotary youth program.  Today, there are more than <span class="boldgold">36,000 Rotary clubs and 10,000 Rotaract clubs</span>, and they are in almost every country in the world.

				<h3>Object of Rotary</h3>
				The <b class="boldgold">Object of Rotary</b> is to encourage and foster the

				<ul class="bodytextmedium">
					<li>
						<b class="boldgold">FIRST</b>: The development of acquaintance as an
						opportunity for service;
					</li>
					<li>
						<b class="boldgold">SECOND</b>: High ethical standards in business and

				<h3>The Four-Way Test</h3>
				<span class="bodytextlarge">
					From the beginning, Rotarians have emphasized the importance
					of acting responsibly and ethically. In <span class="boldgold"> 1932, The Four-Way Test </span> was developed by Herbert Taylor to guide
					him in his profession. Rotary later adopted it, and it
					underscores Rotary’s value of integrity.
