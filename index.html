				<h3>What is Rotary?</h3>
				Rotary is a global network of more than <span class="boldgold">1.4 million</span> people of action in more than <span class="boldgold">46,000</span> clubs who share a passion for and commitment to <span class="boldgold">enhancing communities and improving lives</span> around the world. Rotary clubs exist in almost every country. Our members change lives locally and work on international projects.

				<h3>History of Rotary</h3>
				We’ve been bringing our world closer together for over 100 years. The first Rotary
				club was started in Chicago, Illinois, USA, in <span class="boldgold">1905 </span> by an attorney named <span class="boldgold">Paul Harris</span>. Harris wanted to
				bring together a group of <span class="boldgold">professionals with different backgrounds and skills</span> as a way to exchange ideas
				and form meaningful acquaintances. In August 1910, the 16 Rotary clubs then in the United States formed the National Association of Rotary Clubs, now Rotary International. <span class="boldgold">Rotaract began in 1968</span> as a Rotary youth program.  Today, there are more than <span class="boldgold">36,000 Rotary clubs and 10,000 Rotaract clubs</span>, and they are in almost every country in the world.
